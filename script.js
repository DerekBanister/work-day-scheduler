//Steps to complete

//First i need to display time and date in the jumbotron on page load
//Using moment and the id of currentDay

//Give button onclick that runs a function that saves the input text and
//adds to local storage.

//Then I need to setup the timeblocks/colors for current time, possibly using
//moment aswell. if else statements possibly that use the current hour vs
//the time stated in the block and if it is past that time to give it a class
//or remove a class that colors the field.
